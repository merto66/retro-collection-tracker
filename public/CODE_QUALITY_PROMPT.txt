CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROMPT
===========================================

Please analyze and improve the code quality of this PHP project with the following specific requirements:

1. ERROR MESSAGES STANDARDIZATION
   - Convert ALL error messages to English (currently mixed Turkish/English)
   - Make error messages user-friendly and consistent
   - Examples to fix:
     * "Oops! Something went wrong..." → Use consistent format
     * Any Turkish messages → Convert to English
     * Database error messages → Make them user-friendly

2. COMMENTS CLEANUP
   - Remove unnecessary/redundant comments that just repeat what code does
   - Remove commented-out code blocks
   - Keep only meaningful comments that explain WHY, not WHAT
   - Add missing PHPDoc blocks for functions
   - Examples to remove:
     * "// Include auth check and config file" (obvious from code)
     * "// Define variables" (obvious from code)
     * "// Close connection" (obvious from code)
   - Examples to keep/add:
     * Complex business logic explanations
     * Security-related notes
     * Function documentation

3. CODE DUPLICATION
   - Identify and refactor duplicated code
   - Create reusable functions for common operations:
     * File upload validation
     * Permission checking
     * Error message display
     * Database error handling

4. FUNCTION EXTRACTION
   - Extract complex logic into named functions
   - Examples:
     * File upload handling → create upload_file() function
     * Permission checking → create has_permission() function
     * Image deletion → create delete_old_image() function

5. NAMING CONVENTIONS
   - Ensure consistent variable naming
   - Use descriptive function names
   - Follow PHP naming conventions

6. ERROR HANDLING
   - Replace die() statements with proper error handling
   - Show user-friendly messages instead of technical errors
   - Redirect to error page or show alert instead of killing script

Files to analyze and fix:
- config.php
- create.php
- update.php
- delete.php
- read.php
- index.php
- my_items.php
- login.php
- register.php
- includes/header.php
- includes/footer.php
- includes/auth_check.php

IMPORTANT RULES:
- DO NOT change the core functionality
- DO NOT break existing features
- DO NOT remove security measures (prepared statements, password hashing, etc.)
- DO keep the code structure similar for easy comparison
- DO test after changes to ensure nothing breaks
- DO make incremental changes file by file

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each file:
1. List issues found
2. Show before/after code comparison
3. Explain why changes were made
4. Note any potential side effects

Start with the most critical files first:
1. config.php (error messages, comments)
2. create.php (error handling, comments, file upload)
3. update.php (error handling, comments, file upload)
4. delete.php (error messages, comments)
5. Other files as needed
